## Introduction

So, you decided to be a professor — my condolences.

This is where you must convince others that you will be a successful researcher. Some search committees look for a colleague, some for a strategic investment, and all want someone who fits the department while also adding something new. Writing a research statement is, unfortunately, like planning a wedding: you need to become an expert and hope never to use that expertise again. I’m sharing my own one-time expertise, hoping it will also help you define a research agenda, write grants, and prepare a strong job talk.
