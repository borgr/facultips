## Talk-Specific Advice
Generally giving technical and inspirational talks have many resources, if you just want better presentation skills consider them. (Examples [here](facultips/resources/)) I tried to give common, niche or jobtalk specific advice here.

### The Annoying Person in the Crowd

If someone repeatedly dominates the Q&A with long or irrelevant questions, cut them off politely by saying, “It seems we have a lot to discuss — I’d be happy to continue this offline.” Most faculty will already know who this person is.

### If You Want Questions, Wait

Silence feels awkward only to you. Give the audience time to gather their thoughts. The moment you stop rushing, people start asking.

### Practice, practice, practice

Practice in front of people (ask them for feedback on the things that matteris, is the impact\vision clear etc.), practice by yourself (out loud!).

### Balance non-technical with experties
In general, you want to define everything, assume the audience at best knows what (talented) grad students in your department would know and not more. However, you also don't want to give a TED talk aiming just to inspire, so you are allowed to get deeper and lose some of the audience at a certain point. Ideally, do it once, and allow the audience to catch up with you right away after.

For example: you can talk about three papers, but get into details showing your expertise in one, and before getting to details tell the audience "So far I tried not to put too much burden on you, but here I must" and again when finishing "OK, we are done with this topic." Then change a slide with something attention catching and state a big claim, question or the next thing you talk about.
