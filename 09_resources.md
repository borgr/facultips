### General speech tips:
* TED mastered inspirational talks and are open enough about how to do it: [The TED secret to great public speaking](https://mannerofspeaking.org/2016/05/24/the-ted-secret-to-great-public-speaking/), [How to make a great presentation](https://www.ted.com/playlists/574/how_to_make_a_great_presentation)
* There are [books aplenty](https://get.goreact.com/resources/books-every-public-speaking-guru-has-read/), but I can't attest to any specific ones (I took Coursera courses instead).
