# Faculty Tips
## Call for Collaboration

This aims to help faculty job applicants.
If you have additions or corrections, feel free to comment.

## Introduction

So, you decided to be a professor — my condolences.

This is where you must convince others that you will be a successful researcher. Some search committees look for a colleague, some for a strategic investment, and all want someone who fits the department while also adding something new. Writing a research statement is, unfortunately, like planning a wedding: you need to become an expert and hope never to use that expertise again. I’m sharing my own one-time expertise, hoping it will also help you define a research agenda, write grants, and prepare a strong job talk.

## General Advice

### Apply if You Want It — It Is Their Job to Reject You

Faculty jobs are scarce (thank you, Leshem, for pointing out the obvious), so think carefully about your **best alternative options [(BATNA)](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/batna/translate-your-batna-to-the-current-deal/?utm_source=ktilana.wixsite.com)**:

Ask yourself: if everything else fails, would you actually go there? Or are you just applying out of fear, or habit, or the illusion that more options will somehow feel better? You do not owe any institution loyalty in advance, nor are you expected to accept an offer you do not want. Apply because you want the job; let them decide whether they want you.

Most universities require similar materials, so applying widely is often efficient. Even if you don’t end up joining a place, the process teaches you what the market offers and what you might want to negotiate in the future.

#### When *Not* to Apply

Don’t apply to universities you know you will not join even under the worst-case scenario, whether it’s because of location, personal constraints, lack of opportunities for a partner, language issues, or simply because you would prefer industry or another path.

### Don’t Mind the Call Description Too Much

Unless the call is extremely narrow (as in many European searches), you should never view the listed areas as prohibitions. Call descriptions often reflect administrative compromises rather than the conviction of the faculty who will evaluate you. Hiring committees generally prioritize strong candidates who bring something exciting, even if the call wording doesn’t match perfectly.

### You Are Judged by the Entire Department

Your closest peers will understand you. Others won’t — and they still get a vote. Be clear, accessible, and persuasive about what you do and why it matters. If you cannot explain your research compellingly to someone outside your sub-area, you make their vote harder.

### You Should Appear Like Money

The importance of fundraising varies across countries, but it never hurts to look like someone who can bring resources. Show evidence of securing grants, writing them, collaborating with funded partners, or joining large projects. Even small successes can demonstrate momentum.

### Have a Vision in the Sky (But Make It Believable)

Hiring committees want to invest in the future. Present a vision big enough to feel transformative, clear enough to feel real, and grounded enough to make you look like the person who can deliver it. A compelling long-term direction does not need to be guaranteed — it simply needs to be plausible and motivated. Bonus points if it is something only you can naturally pursue.

### You Are a Scientist

This may sound obvious, but especially in engineering fields people sometimes lose sight of it. Ultimately, committees want concrete scientific insights: important questions, surprising results, and contributions that push a field forward. Methodology matters, but it is not the whole story.

### Show Impact Beyond Citations

Anyone can check your citation metrics. Distinguish yourself by showing impact they cannot see in Google Scholar. This can be high-quality press coverage, widely used datasets or libraries, downloads, industry adoption, invitations, or prizes, offered to be X. Screenshots and graphs help make these tangible.


### Find Supporters

Connections within a department can help you long before your application is submitted. Talk to people at conferences, give seminars, and stay in touch with collaborators. Departmental politics are real; supportive voices in the room can make an enormous difference.

### Unique but also consrvative
From teaching goals to vision there is always a fine balance. Uiversities claim to strive high, but they are very conservative. So, if you are really unique and want a place to embrace it do it and you will land the places that cherish it. Jordan Peterson, once said that he joined Harvard and from the beginning they knew he has unique opinions. Otherwise, hiding them only until X (Graduation, tenure,...) would have meant holdingit forever.

On the contrary, if you do not believe in it and just stress to impress, no need, just be honest.

## Who to Ask for Recommendations

### Required Recommenders

In most systems you must include your advisors and any postdoc hosts. If someone has passed away or is otherwise impossible to contact, check with the institution about acceptable alternatives.

### Avoid Hesitant Writers

A lukewarm letter is worse than none. If someone is not enthusiastic, thank them and find someone else. This is a place where “maybe” really means “no.”

### Don’t Suggest External Recommenders When the University Will Solicit Them

Some institutions seek external letters from people you did not nominate to check seniority and independence. If that is the case, don’t propose someone who barely knows you; doing so “uses up” a person the institution might have chosen themselves and pushes them toward someone even more distant.

## The Research Statement

### Introduction

#### Open Strong — Think Yuval Noah Harari

Great papers and popular science pieces start with a compelling narrative. So should you. Begin with a broad, engaging framing that shows your field touches something big and important, then narrow the focus to what you do.

#### State What You Do Immediately

Help committees route and interpret your application. Ideally, the first sentence should state your topic plainly. This helps set expectations and keeps readers oriented.

#### Convince Us Your Field Matters

Not everyone on a committee will be from your area. Explain why your field is significant at the scientific, societal, or conceptual level. If you don’t do it, they may not do it for you.

#### Bring Achievements Early

Many readers skim only the introduction and vision. Highlight your most important achievements early enough that even skimmers walk away impressed.

---

### Past Work

Organize past research by **direction**, not by paper. You are not summarizing your CV; you are presenting the intellectual threads that define your work. For each direction, describe the overarching idea, what you contributed, why it mattered, and how it shaped the field. One sentence per paper is usually enough.

---

### Future Work

Future work should feel like a professorial long-term plan, not a disconnected wish list. Present yourself as someone who already thinks and acts like faculty. Show continuity with your past work — that you have already taken the first steps — and then outline what comes next and why it matters. Impact beyond citations also belongs here: show how your work might shape tools, communities, understanding, industry, or society.

Some departments will compare you to everyone else in your subfield; others will ask whether your work constitutes a new direction they want to invest in. Interdisciplinary candidates should consider applying to multiple departments and tailoring statements to each audience.

## Talk-Specific Advice

### The Annoying Person in the Crowd

If someone repeatedly dominates the Q&A with long or irrelevant questions, cut them off politely by saying, “It seems we have a lot to discuss — I’d be happy to continue this offline.” Most faculty will already know who this person is.

### If You Want Questions, Wait

Silence feels awkward only to you. Give the audience time to gather their thoughts. The moment you stop rushing, people start asking.

---

## Teaching statement

Oh, yeah, we need this too... This is how most research heavy universities (in US R1) think about it, other fields or universities where the only thing sustaining them is teaching care more.

### Active learning

Beyond being an ML field, this is maybe the only thing that we are really expected to know about teaching. Standing in front of the class and lecturing, is a way most stodents benefit less from.  
*Actively* engaging with the material, teaches more. Regrettably, most universities pay the lip service only.

### Show you thought about it

They want to see you thought about it, you have a plan, you know if you want it to be very theoretic, hands-on, broad, deep etc. and why this fits your field.

#### Evaluation and assessment

Did you think about it?


### Connect it to your research



### Experience

In most places, for a starting tenure track position, they don't expect too much teaching experience, if you have it, great, otherwise, don't stress about it. Also, everything count, I taught a university course, but if I hadn't, teaching swing dances, TA and other stuff would still be worth mentioning. Mentioning, not focusing on. They mainly want potential not seasoned teachers.

If you happen to have proof. So like the researcher impact, don't say you are good, proove you are.

### Mentorship

Often as teaching is secondary and you have little experience, you can talk about mentorship and mentorship values here as well (some calls even ask for it).
