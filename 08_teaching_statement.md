## Teaching statement

Oh, yeah, we need this too... This is how most research heavy universities (in US R1) think about it, other fields or universities where the only thing sustaining them is teaching care more.

### Active learning

Beyond being an ML field, this is maybe the only thing that we are really expected to know about teaching. Standing in front of the class and lecturing, is a way most stodents benefit less from.  
*Actively* engaging with the material, teaches more. Regrettably, most universities pay the lip service only.

### Show you thought about it

They want to see you thought about it, you have a plan, you know if you want it to be very theoretic, hands-on, broad, deep etc. and why this fits your field.

#### Evaluation and assessment

Did you think about it?


### Connect it to your research



### Experience

In most places, for a starting tenure track position, they don't expect too much teaching experience, if you have it, great, otherwise, don't stress about it. Also, everything count, I taught a university course, but if I hadn't, teaching swing dances, TA and other stuff would still be worth mentioning. Mentioning, not focusing on. They mainly want potential not seasoned teachers.

If you happen to have proof. So like the researcher impact, don't say you are good, proove you are.

### Mentorship

Often as teaching is secondary and you have little experience, you can talk about mentorship and mentorship values here as well (some calls even ask for it).
