### Past Work

Organize past research by **direction**, not by paper. You are not summarizing your CV; you are presenting the intellectual threads that define your work. For each direction, describe the overarching idea, what you contributed, why it mattered, and how it shaped the field. One sentence per paper is usually enough.
