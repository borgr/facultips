## The Research Statement

### Introduction

#### Open Strong — Think Yuval Noah Harari

Great papers and popular science pieces start with a compelling narrative. So should you. Begin with a broad, engaging framing that shows your field touches something big and important, then narrow the focus to what you do.

#### State What You Do Immediately

Help committees route and interpret your application. Ideally, the first sentence should state your topic plainly. This helps set expectations and keeps readers oriented.

#### Convince Us Your Field Matters

Not everyone on a committee will be from your area. Explain why your field is significant at the scientific, societal, or conceptual level. If you don’t do it, they may not do it for you.

#### Bring Achievements Early

Many readers skim only the introduction and vision. Highlight your most important achievements early enough that even skimmers walk away impressed.
