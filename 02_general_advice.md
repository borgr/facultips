## General Advice

### About applying
#### Apply if You Want It — It Is Their Job to Reject You

Faculty jobs are scarce (thank you, Leshem, for pointing out the obvious), so think carefully about your **best alternative options [(BATNA)](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/batna/translate-your-batna-to-the-current-deal/?utm_source=ktilana.wixsite.com)**:

Ask yourself: if everything else fails, would you actually go there? Or are you just applying out of fear, or habit, or the illusion that more options will somehow feel better? You do not owe any institution loyalty in advance, nor are you expected to accept an offer you do not want. Apply because you want the job; let them decide whether they want you.

Most universities require similar materials, so applying widely is often efficient. Even if you don’t end up joining a place, the process teaches you what the market offers and what you might want to negotiate in the future.

##### When *Not* to Apply

Don’t apply to universities you know you will not join even under the worst-case scenario, whether it’s because of location, personal constraints, lack of opportunities for a partner, language issues, or simply because you would prefer industry or another path.

#### Don’t Mind the Call Description Too Much

Unless the call is extremely narrow (as in many European searches), you should never view the listed areas as prohibitions. Call descriptions often reflect administrative compromises rather than the conviction of the faculty who will evaluate you. Hiring committees generally prioritize strong candidates who bring something exciting, even if the call wording doesn’t match perfectly.

### You Are Judged by the Entire Department

Your closest peers will understand you. Others won’t — and they still get a vote. Be clear, accessible, and persuasive about what you do and why it matters. If you cannot explain your research compellingly to someone outside your sub-area, you make their vote harder.

### Selling Yourself (in statements, talks, and grants)

#### Have a Vision in the Sky (But Make It Believable)

Hiring committees want to invest in the future. Present a vision big enough to feel transformative, clear enough to feel real, and grounded enough to make you look like the person who can deliver it. A compelling long-term direction does not need to be guaranteed — it simply needs to be plausible and motivated. Bonus points if it is something only you can naturally pursue.

#### You Are a Scientist

This may sound obvious, but especially in engineering fields people sometimes lose sight of it. Ultimately, committees want concrete scientific insights: important questions, surprising results, and contributions that push a field forward. Methodology matters, but it is not the whole story.

#### Show Impact Beyond Citations

Anyone can check your citation metrics. Distinguish yourself by showing impact they cannot see in Google Scholar. This can be high-quality press coverage, widely used datasets or libraries, downloads, industry adoption, invitations, or prizes, offered to be X. Screenshots and graphs help make these tangible.

#### Unique but also consrvative
From teaching goals to vision there is always a fine balance. Uiversities claim to strive high, but they are very conservative. So, if you are really unique and want a place to embrace it do it and you will land the places that cherish it. Jordan Peterson, once said that he joined Harvard and from the beginning they knew he has unique opinions. Otherwise, hiding them only until X (Graduation, tenure,...) would have meant holdingit forever.

On the contrary, if you do not believe in it and just stress to impress, no need, just be honest.

#### You Should Appear Like Money

The importance of fundraising varies across countries, but it never hurts to look like someone who can bring resources. Show evidence of securing grants, writing them, collaborating with funded partners, or joining large projects. Even small successes can demonstrate momentum.



### Find Supporters

Connections within a department can help you long before your application is submitted. Talk to people at conferences, give seminars, and stay in touch with collaborators. Departmental politics are real; supportive voices in the room can make an enormous difference.

#### Peers Are Often Willing to Help
Practice against them what you did and your impact (and even others that are less acquainted with your field). Ask people your questions (How much starting money should I ask for, can I see your research statement etc.)
